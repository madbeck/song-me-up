# cs0320 Term Project 2018



**all ideas approved** however given that javascript is a group weakness, project one might be a mistake. I would also add features to your dj application, but it's a solid idea. -adehovit

**Team Members:**
Maddie Becker, Sam Oliphant, Shell Yang, and Thomas Vandermillen

**Team Strengths and Weaknesses:** 

Strengths: Systems programming, OOP, HTML, CSS, Humor

Weaknesses: Javascript, using libraries, connecting backend to frontend efficiently

**Project Idea(s):**

1) What problems do these ideas attempt to solve?
2) How your project will solve them?
3) What critical features you will need to develop, why are those features are being included, and what will you expect to be the most challenging about each feature?

Ideas:

üíª Gui for gui's üíª 
1) Attempts to overcome tedious gui-making processes by creating an intuitive and clean gui-generator.
2) The gui-generator will provide an experience that is somewhere in between interacting with the HTML/CSS code by hand and using a template-driven service like Squarespace. For example, users will be able to drag and drop their own website elements, and corresponding code will automatically generate for users to copy and paste into a code document.
3) We will need to develop reusable and scalable javascript, as well as a backend that organizes HTML and CSS code into subclasses in order to be easily sent back to the frontend. We expect the javascript will be especially challenging as we advance towards a cleaner, more sophisticated interface.

üç≥Gordon Ramsay‚Äôs Recipe generator üç≥
1) Resolves college students / fitness gurus‚Äô lack of inspiration in creating palatable dishes with limited set of ingredients. It encourages cooking and helps to counteract the obesity epidemic that is plaguing our nation.
2) We will load in recipes from websites, specifically - the ingredients for them. We will also ask for user input on the specific quantities at their disposal. We match approximately equal amounts of resources and suggest dishes. You can also put constraints on the searches - cuisines, difficulty level, number of servings, occasion, etc.
3) We will have to establish interaction with a recipe website in order to gather information about various recipes and return them back to the user. Additionally, these results will depend on the setting of multiple constraints by the user, so an additional feature would generate and rank recipe suggestions. Finally, it would be cool to make this application mobile-friendly, and also relatively quick for inputting ingredients. A system for remembering past items would also be helpful.

üî•Signmeup/song requester for parties üî•
1) So often, DJs at a party aren‚Äôt aware of the music tastes of the crowd, and do a poor job at stirring excitement. It‚Äôs also terribly difficult to scream in the DJ‚Äôs ear and tell them what you want to hear next. 
2) With a music requester, attendees can ‚ÄúSign me up‚Äù their songs. DJ‚Äôs can ‚Äúclaim ticket‚Äù or ‚Äúdelete ticket‚Äù if they support or feel repelled by a particular requester‚Äôs music taste. You also don‚Äôt want all those crew boys requesting ‚ÄúMr. Brightside‚Äù every 5 minutes. However, to counteract those mean DJ‚Äôs, if enough people request the same song, it will have to be played.
3) Some critical features are...
  - Receiving and updating the song requests in real time, managing concurrency threads 
  - Joining the server of polling data from different devices
  - Location sharing
  - Visualizing the music that is requested - maybe pulling information on the song and having an interactive interface for both the DJ and the requesters.
