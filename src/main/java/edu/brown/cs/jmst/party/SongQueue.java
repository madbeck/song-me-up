  //TODO: make this more sophisticated:
  // determine the importance of the various audio features in terms of similarness between songs

  //Important!
  // valence, danceability

  //look at all songs currently in pool of suggestions
  //baseline ordering: time added (first in first out)
  //make adjustments based on votes: X vetoes (or Y% of partygoers) negatively impacts suggestion's standing
  //I'm beginning to suspect that the highest priority (after making sure that
  //  people feel like their input matters in a FAIR and reasonable way), is to
  //  ensure that there are no jarring changes in VALENCE (particularly high to low??)

  //It's probably preferred to have high danceability songs, most of the time. But maybe not always.

  //What would be super cool is if I can keep track of whioh songs are being
  // suggested, which songs are being voted up, and which are being voted down,
  // then use the data to adjust the algorithm's priorities in real time.

  //ASSUMPTION: it is likely that if a person makes a suggestion Y during song X,
  // they would be happiest if Y plays immediately after X

  //IDEA: what if, when making a suggestion, you could flag it as "low priority",
  // meaning you would like to hear this song EVENTUALLY, as opposed to immediately after the current song
  // -Alternatively, flag suggestion as "eventually", "soon", or "next"
  //  * limited number of "next" uses, because it would give the song significantly more weight
  //  * maybe "soon" could become disabled once there are already too many songs to pick from
  //    ~ or just have it default to "soon" without making it a visible option.
  //    ~ allow people who don't really care that much to pick "eventually" (with perhaps the [hidden] promise that the song will be played at some point, no matter what)
  //    ~ allow people who want their song NOW to pick "next", with maybe special considerations to deal with the case where a lot of people want a song next
  //      + vote on X suggestions to get back the ability to make a song higher priority
  //      + have Y people vote your suggestion up (while in queue or while playing) to get back "next" ability, where Y is lower than X

  //IDEA: while a song is playing, let people express their opinion about the current song

  //For now, assume that songs are only voted on in the queue

  //1. Order added to queue
  //2. Most positive votes
  //3. Attempt to eliminate large jumps in valence [best guess right now: ~5? Could be lower if the TWO examples I have now are on the extreme end (need more data!)]
  //4. Avoid consecutive songs with "low" danceability
  //5.
